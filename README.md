# Document Conflation 
We use KeyMapping based on our research paper for two datasets  
More methods can be found [DocumentConflation_Comparisons](https://github.com/ryhiltabrand/S2ORC-Research/tree/main/DocumentConflation_Comparisons)

## Locality Sensitive Hashing  
* LSH is an algorithm that breaks an input string into pieces (shingles) and hashes similar strings into the same “buckets’ with high probability [11].  
* It has been used as an efficient method to resolve near-duplicate news articles [7].  

## Key-mapping
* Key-mapping is a conflation method used by Cite-SeerX [23].   
* In this method, several keys are generated for each
paper by concatenating a portion of title and author information.
